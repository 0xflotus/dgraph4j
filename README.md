# Dgraph Client for Java

A minimal implementation for a Dgraph client in Java using [grpc].

[grpc]: https://grpc.io/

This client follows the [Dgraph Go client][goclient] closely.

[goclient]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/tree/master/client

Before using this client, we highly recommend that you go through [docs.dgraph.io],
and understand how to run and work with Dgraph.

## Download
_TODO add a link to jar file_

grab via Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.dgraph</groupId>
  <artifactId>dgraph4j</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.2</version>
</dependency>
```
or Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'io.dgraph:dgraph4j:0.9.2'
```

## Quickstart
Build and run the [DgraphJavaSample] project in the `samples` folder, which
contains an end-to-end example of using the Dgraph Java client. Follow the
instructions in the README of that project.

## Development

### Building the source

```
./gradlew build
```
If you have made changes to the `task.proto` file, this step will also regenerate the source files
generated by Protocol Buffer tools.

### Code Style
We use [google-java-format] to format the source code. If you run `./gradlew build`, you will be warned
if there is code that is not conformant. You can run `./gradlew goJF` to format the source code, before
commmitting it.

### Running unit tests
Make sure you have a Dgraph server running on localhost before you run this task.

```
./gradlew test
```
